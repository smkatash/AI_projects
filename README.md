### [Text Generation with an RNN, Tensorflow](https://github.com/smkatash/AI_projects/tree/master/text_generation)

By following the tutorial on [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/text/tutorials/text_generation) , I generated a text using a character-based Recurrent Neural Networks. 
Dataset is based on Shakespeare's writing. Given a sequence of characters from the data, a LSTM-based model is trained to predict the next character in the sequence. Longer sequences of text can be generated by calling the model repeatedly.

After applying [temperature sampling](https://keras.io/examples/generative/lstm_character_level_text_generation/) with different temperature values, the following texts with conditional probability distributions over the vocabulary for the given temperature values were generated:

```bash
---------Temperature: 0.2---------
